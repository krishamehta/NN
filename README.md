# NEURAL NETWORKS

This project helps you understand neural networks while working on a project.
Let us first understand what neural networks are and how to they work:

<ul><li> WHAT EXACTLY ARE NEURAL NETWORKS</li></ul>
<p>Neural networks are greatly inspired by the working of the human brain.
Each node of the network represents a "neuron" like in the brain.These networks normally consists of thousands of nodes.
These nodes are divided in various layers.</p>
<p>The first layer is the input layer, the last is the output layer. The layers in the middle have no connection with the outside world and are hence called as hidden layers.One of the most fundamental property of these classic neural nets is that every node of the pevious layer is connected to every node of the next layer.
